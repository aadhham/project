  <h2>The Simple Quad Stretch</h2>
  <p>1. Stand on your left leg, one knee touching the other. You can hold a chair or the wall to keep you steady if needed.<br><br>
2.  Grab your right foot, using your right hand, and pull it towards your butt. Be sure to push your chest up and hips forward. Try not to worry about pushing your foot too close to your backside; your focus should be on feeling the stretch in your quad muscle and pushing your hips forward to get a good hip flexor stretch.<br><br>
3.  Hold the position for 20 to 30 seconds, then repeat, switching from your left leg to your right.</p>

  <h2>The Kneeling Quad Stretch</h2>
  <p>A slightly different form of quad stretch, this position will help to loosen the muscles just above the knee joint, increasing mobility and preventing knee pain.</p>
  <p>1. Start the stretch in a high lunge position, with your left foot forward.<br><br>
2.  Carefully drop your right knee to the floor and take a moment to find your balance.<br><br>
3. Once you’re ready, reach back with your right arm, and grab your ankle, or toes, depending on what’s easiest.<br><br>
4. Hold the position for 30 seconds, keeping your body steady. Push a little further to get a hip flexor stretch as well.<br><br>
5. Gradually come back into the starting position and switch from your left foot to your right.

  <h2>Standing quad stretch</h2>
  <h3>Steps:</h3>
  <p>1-Shift your weight to your left foot, and carefully lift your right foot from the ground, bending your right knee as you draw your right heel toward your right butt cheek.<br><br>
2-To help with balance, stand next to a wall or sturdy chair and place your left hand lightly on the object to help you stay upright and steady.<br><br>
3- Reach back with your right hand and grab the top of your right foot or ankle. Use your hand to gently draw your right heel closer to your butt. Avoid tipping forward at the hips—you want to maintain good posture throughout the exercise.<br><br>
4- When you feel a stretch through the front of your right thigh, hold the position for 20 to 30 seconds. Release for a breath, then repeat the exercise two to three more times before switching sides.
